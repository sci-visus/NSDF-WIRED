    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to NSDF’s UBC Firesmoke Data Curation website. Here we describe the data curation process of UBC’s Smoke Forecast datasets. We inform readers of the challenges and solutions we found when repurposing these short term datasets into a long term dataset.\nIt is important to note that although we will present the data curation process in a linear fashion here, it was not a linear process, nor could it be. Rather, the process was cyclical, and at each iteration we introduced new improvements.",

    "text": "Wildfires in North America have significantly impacted ecosystems and human society [1]. Climate change affects the frequency, duration, and severity of wildfires thus necessitating the use of wildfire prediction systems to effectively mitigate wildfire impact. However, data for understanding the impact of climate change on wildfires is limited, only available for a few regions and for only a few decades [2]. Furthermore, wildfire prediction systems in North America prioritize decision making and fire management on short timescales, from minutes to months. Therefore, long term wildfire prediction systems have limited access to aggregate short term data, due to resource constraints from fire management entities to share the data they collect and curate.\nThe Weather Forecast Research Team at the University of British Columbia (UBC) generates a short term dataset of PM2.5 smoke particulate presence in North America. Over the past 3 years, each day four times a day, UBC has created forecasts of PM2.5 smoke particulate on the ground for Canada and the continental United States. This is done using their The BlueSky Western Canada Wildfire Smoke Forecasting System. UBC provides access to this data to paying customers and for free on a daily basis via a web-based visualization and file download.\nThese smoke predictions are useful for those who must make decisions on how to deal with smoke as it comes. However, these years of forecasts are not available in a non-trivial fashion for long term forecasting. The data only exists among the hundreds of netCDF files that UBC has generated.\nOur task is to obtain a single long term dataset from the smoke forecast files that are available from UBC.\n\n2 References\n[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/583890.583893\n[2] climate change and wildfire article that was in spanish",

The following shows our approaches to doing this and discusses how our approach evolved.\nTo create our dataset, we operated under the following assumptions about the NetCDF files: 1. All files across all four forecast IDs have the same NROWS, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL values. 2. Some files have either NCOLS = 1041 or NCOLS = 1081. 3. {C,W,S}_DATE and {C,W,S}_TIME values are unique to each file.",

Therefore, the latest data must be downloaded on a regular basis. We have not implemented this process yet, so the latest forecast files we use are up to June 27, 2024.\nThere is no official source stating the earliest available date for each forecast. So, knowing the project began in 2021, we inferenced that the earliest available date would be in 2021. Via trial and error we found the earliest available dates.\n\n\n3.1.2 Download Instructions\nTo download the 2-day forecast for the forecast initialization date of one’s choice, one follows the instructions below. The downloaded file can be a NetCDF or KMZ file. We use NetCDF files. Later in Chapter 4 we detail our automation of the download process described below.\n\nTODO CREDIT UBC\nGo to this URL: https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/{ForecastID}/{YYYYMMDD}{InitTime}/{File Type}\nReplace YYYYMMDD with the date of choice.
