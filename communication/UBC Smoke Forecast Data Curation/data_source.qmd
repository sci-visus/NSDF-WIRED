# The Data Source {#sec-data-source}
It is important to understand exactly what data is available and how to obtain that data. 

Here we establish:

- What systems are available to obtain the smoke forecast data from UBC?
- What are in the files that UBC provides?
- What metadata is associated with the files we obtain, both from within the file and the files as a whole?

This information **was not** determined the first time we explored this dataset. 

As seen in the later chapters, we operated under misinformed assumptions and encountered issues only resolvable by operating on the data "blindly". The purpose of this chapter is to establish the final set of information we learned about our data source after extensive exploration and manipulation.

## Downloading UBC Smoke Forecast Files

### Available Time Range

The time ranges of available data for each forecast ID is shown in @tbl-time. Please note, there are occassional **failed forecasts or otherwise unavailable files** within the date ranges specified @tbl-time.

| Forecast ID             | Description                                                                                     | Start Date | End Date   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| BSC00CA12-01   | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 00Z met (12km grid), 08Z fires, North America domain              | March 4, 2021   | Present Day   |
| BSC06CA12-01   | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 06Z met (12km grid), 14Z fires, North America domain              | March 4, 2021   | Present Day   |
| BSC12CA12-01   | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 12Z met (12km grid), 20Z fires, North America domain              | March 3, 2021   | Present Day   |
| BSC18CA12-01   | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 18Z met (12km grid), 02Z fires, North America domain              | March 4, 2021   | Present Day   |
: Dates for which all Forecast ID Datasets are Publicly Available {#tbl-time}

The smoke forecasts are updated daily, including the present day, so there is no fixed end date. Therefore, the latest data must be downloaded on a regular basis. We have not implemented this process yet, so the latest forecast files we use are up to June 27, 2024.

There is no official source stating the earliest available date for each forecast. So, knowing the project began in 2021, we inferenced that the earliest available date would be in 2021. Via trial and error we found the earliest available dates.

### Download Instructions

To download the 2-day forecast for the forecast initialization date of one's choice, one follows the instructions below. The downloaded file can be a NetCDF or KMZ file. We use NetCDF files. Later in @sec-data-loading we detail our automation of the download process described below.

**TODO CREDIT UBC**

Go to this URL: `https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/{ForecastID}/{YYYYMMDD}{InitTime}/{File Type}`

Replace `YYYYMMDD` with the date of choice. Replace `ForecastID` and `InitTime` with the appropriate values as described in @tbl-access:

| Forecast ID  | Description                                       | Initialization Time |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| BSC00CA12-01 | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 00Z met (12km grid), 08Z fires, North America domain | 08                  |
| BSC06CA12-01 | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 06Z met (12km grid), 14Z fires, North America domain | 14                  |
| BSC12CA12-01 | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 12Z met (12km grid), 20Z fires, North America domain | 20                  |
| BSC18CA12-01 | BlueSky Canada smoke forecast, 18Z met (12km grid), 02Z fires, North America domain | 02                  |
: UBC Smoke Forecast Data Download Parameters {#tbl-access}

#### Download Example

Let's try downloading the forecast for January 1, 2024 where the forecast is initiated at 00:00:00 UTC by navigating to the corresponding URL.

```{python}
forecast_id = "BSC00CA12-01"
yyyymmdd = "20210304"
init_time = "08"

url = (
    f"https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/{forecast_id}/{yyyymmdd}{init_time}/dispersion.nc"
)

print(f"Navigate to this URL in your browser: {url}")
```

## The NetCDF File
Next, let's look at what is within the NetCDF file located at the URL in our previous example.

### File Preview
<!-- **TODO, MOVE TO ANOTHER SPOT**: To view and manipulate NetCDF files, we have selected the `xarray` Python library and created a [custom built backend](https://github.com/sci-visus/openvisuspy/blob/a2570ab485802375c075b6dbc0e3c79ebca02d02/src/openvisuspy/xarray_backend.py#L2) that connects `xarray` to the `OpenVisus` framework.

**TODO**
The file downloaded at the specified URL download the 2-day forecast for [DATE] and [TIME] one could download the following files.
[GET 2 DAY FORECAST DESCRIPTION FROM scribbles.ipynb]. -->

We load `dispersion.nc` using `xarray`.

```{python}
import xarray as xr

ds = xr.open_dataset("data/data_source/dispersion.nc")
ds
```

### File Attributes {#attr}

`dispersion.nc` contains the following attributes. Note that for all files across forecast IDs, they have the same dimension and variable names:

#### Dimensions:
These dimensions determine on which indicies we may index our variables.

| Dimension  | Size | Description                                                                                       |
|------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TSTEP      | 51   | This dimension represents the number of time steps in the file. Each file has 51 hours represented.                                   |
| VAR        | 1    | This dimension is a placeholder for the variables in the file.     |
| DATE-TIME  | 2    | This dimension stores the date and time information for each time step.                           |
| LAY        | 1    | This dimension represents the number of layers in the file, which is 1 in this case.              |
| ROW        | 381  | This dimension represents the number of rows in the spatial grid.                                 |

#### Variables:
These variables contain the data in question that we would like to extract.

| Variable | Dimensions            | Data Type | Description                                                                            |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TFLAG    | (TSTEP, VAR, DATE-TIME) | int32     | This variable stores the date and time of each time step.                               |
| PM25     | (TSTEP, LAY, ROW, COL) | float32   | This variable contains the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) for each time step, layer, row, and column in the spatial grid. |

#### Attributes
Of the 33 available attributes we use the following:

## Metadata of Collected NetCDF Files
Our goal is to use all the available NetCDF files to create single dataset. Here we describe metadata about the collection of NetCDF files we downloaded.

### Disk Size

For the time ranges we cover, the following table shows how large the set of files per forecast ID are.

| Forecast ID    | Date Range                          | Size  | File Count |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| BSC00CA12-01   | March 4, 2021 - June 27, 2024          | 84G   | 1077       |
| BSC06CA12-01   | March 4, 2021 - June 27, 2024          | 78G   | 1022       |
| BSC12CA12-01   | March 3, 2021 - June 27, 2024          | 79G   | 1022       |
| BSC18CA12-01   | March 4, 2021 - June 27, 2024          | 79G   | 1023       |
| **Total**      |                                     | **320G** | **4144**   |


### Data Uniformity
To create our dataset, we used the following understanding about the attributes across all files:

1. All files across all four forecast IDs have the same `NROWS`, `XORIG`, `YORIG`, `XCELL`, `YCELL` values.
2. Some files have either `NCOLS = 1041` or `NCOLS = 1081`.
3. `{C,W,S}_DATE` and `{C,W,S}_TIME` values are unique to each file.
