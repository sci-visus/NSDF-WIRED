# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to NSDF's UBC Firesmoke Data Curation website. Here we describe the data curation process of UBC's Smoke Forecast datasets. We inform readers of the challenges and solutions we found when repurposing these short term datasets into a long term dataset.

It is important to note that although we will present the data curation process in a linear fashion here, it was not a linear process. Rather, the process was cyclical, and at each iteration we introduced new improvements.
