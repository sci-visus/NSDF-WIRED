- `bokeh_dashboard` contains current work on making an interactive visual dashboard for the dataset
- `demos` contains self-contained demos using the firesmoke idx conversion.
- `make_videos` contains scripts for generating .mp4 videos of all of the firesmoke data. This takes 3-4 hours to run.
- other notebooks here are quick and dirty visualizations to inspect data in other contexts.

please note, most old notebooks may not run due to the data source having been moved or removed.
The value of keeping these old notebooks of visualizations is to preserve code of how to visualize the dataset we are working with.
